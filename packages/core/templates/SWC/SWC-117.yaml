  severity: critical
  description:
	The implementation of a cryptographic signature system in Ethereum contracts 	often assumes that the signature is unique, but signatures can be altered 	without the possession of the private key and still be valid. The EVM 	specification defines several so-called ‘precompiled’ contracts one of them 	being `ecrecover` which executes the elliptic curve public key recovery. A 	malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create 	other valid signatures. A system that performs signature verification on 	contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the 	signed message hash. Valid signatures could be created by a malicious user to 	replay previously signed messages.

  name: Presence of unused variables
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	Unused variables are allowed in Solidity and they do not pose a direct security 	issue. It is best practice though to avoid them as they can:
		-cause an increase in computations (and unnecessary gas consumption)
		-indicate bugs or malformed data structures and they are generally a sign of 	poor code quality
		-cause code noise and decrease readability of the code

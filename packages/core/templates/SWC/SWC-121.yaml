  name: Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	It is sometimes necessary to perform signature verification in smart contracts 	to achieve better usability or to save gas cost. A secure implementation needs 	to protect against Signature Replay Attacks by for example keeping track of all 	processed message hashes and only allowing new message hashes to be processed. A	 malicious user could attack a contract without such a control and get message 	hash that was sent by another user processed multiple times.

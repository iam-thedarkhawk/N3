  description:
	There exists a special variant of a message call, named `delegatecall` which is 	identical to a message call apart from the fact that the code at the target 	address is executed in the context of the calling contract and `msg.sender` and 	`msg.value` do not change their values. This allows a smart contract to 	dynamically load code from a different address at runtime. Storage, current 	address and balance still refer to the calling contract.

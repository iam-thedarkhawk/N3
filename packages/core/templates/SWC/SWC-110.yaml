  name: Assert Violation
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
  The Solidity `assert()` function is meant to assert invariants. Properly 	functioning code should *never* reach a failing assert statement. A reachable 	assertion can mean one of two things:
1. A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state;
2. The `assert` statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs.

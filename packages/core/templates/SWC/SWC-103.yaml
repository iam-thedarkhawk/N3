  severity: critical
  description: 
  Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they 	have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that 	contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated 	compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

  name: Write to Arbitrary Storage Location
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	A smart contract's data (e.g., storing the owner of the contract) is persistently	 stored at some storage location (i.e., a key or address) on the EVM level. The 	contract is responsible for ensuring that only authorized user or contract 	accounts may write to sensitive storage locations. If an attacker is able to 	write to arbitrary storage locations of a contract, the authorization checks may	 easily be circumvented. This can allow an attacker to corrupt the storage; for 	instance, by overwriting a field that stores the address of the contract owner.

  name: Requirement Violation
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	The Solidity `require()` construct is meant to validate external inputs of a 	function. In most cases, such external inputs are provided by callers, but they 	may also be returned by callees. In the former case, we refer to them as 	precondition violations. Violations of a requirement can indicate one of two 	possible issues:
1. A bug exists in the contract that provided the external input.
2. The condition used to express the requirement is too strong.

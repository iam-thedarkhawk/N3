  name: Shadowing State Variables
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	Solidity allows for ambiguous naming of state variables when inheritance is used.	 Contract `A` with a variable `x` could inherit contract `B` that also has a 	state variable `x` defined. This would result in two separate versions of `x`, 	one of them being accessed from contract `A` and the other one from contract `B`.	 In more complex contract systems this condition could go unnoticed and 	subsequently lead to security issues.

Shadowing state variables can also occur within a single contract when there are	 multiple definitions on the contract and function level.

  name: Arbitrary Jump with Function Type Variable
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	Solidity supports function types. That is, a variable of function type can be 	assigned with a reference to a function with a matching signature. The function 	saved to such variable can be called just like a regular function.

The problem arises when a user has the ability to arbitrarily change the 	function type variable and thus execute random code instructions. As Solidity 	doesn't support pointer arithmetics, it's impossible to change such variable to 	an arbitrary value. However, if the developer uses assembly instructions, such 	as `mstore` or assign operator, in the worst case scenario an attacker is able 	to point a function type variable to any code instruction, violating required 	validations and required state changes.

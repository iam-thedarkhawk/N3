  name: Typographical Error
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	A typographical error can occur for example when the intent of a defined 	operation is to sum a number to a variable (+=) but it has accidentally been 	defined in a wrong way (=+), introducing a typo which happens to be a valid 	operator. Instead of calculating the sum it initializes the variable again. The 	unary + operator is deprecated in new solidity compiler versions.

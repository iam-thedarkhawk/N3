  name: Block values as a proxy for time
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	Contracts often need access to time values to perform certain types of 	functionality. Values such as `block.timestamp`, and `block.number` can give you	 a sense of the current time or a time delta, however, they are not safe to use 	for most purposes.

In the case of `block.timestamp`, developers often attempt to use it to trigger 	time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time 	only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their	 blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners 	can't set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be	 rejected), nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking 	all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of	 the provided timestamp.

As for `block.number`, considering the block time on Ethereum is generally about	 14 seconds, it's possible to predict the time delta between blocks. However, 	block times are not constant and are subject to change for a variety of reasons,	 e.g. fork reorganisations and the difficulty bomb. Due to variable block times,	 `block.number` should also not be relied on for precise calculations of time.

  name: Incorrect Constructor Name
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract	 creation. They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the 	owner of the contract. Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining 	a constructor was to create a function with the same name as the contract class 	containing it. A function meant to become a constructor becomes a normal, 	callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name.
This behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart 	contract code is re-used with a different name but the name of the constructor 	function is not changed accordingly.

  severity: critical
  description: 
  An overflow/underflow happens when an arithmetic operation reaches the maximum or	 minimum size of a type. For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it	 means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 	2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic 	operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that 	can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum 	or lower than the minimum representable value.

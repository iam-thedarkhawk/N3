  name: Authorization through tx.origin
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	`tx.origin` is a global variable in Solidity which returns the address of the 	account that sent the transaction. Using the variable for authorization could 	make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious 	contract. A call could be made to the vulnerable contract that passes the 	authorization check since `tx.origin` returns the original sender of the 	transaction which in this case is the authorized account.

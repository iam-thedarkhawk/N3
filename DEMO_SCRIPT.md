## DEMO 2: BLOCKSCOUT WIDGET (20 seconds)

### Browser Action:
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/

### What to Say:
*"Now let's see how this looks on Blockscout when users explore contracts..."*

### Terminal Command (to trigger analysis):
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contractAddress": "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"}' \
  | jq '{
      contractName: .blockscout.contractName,
      verified: .blockscout.verified,
      compiler: .blockscout.compiler,
      transactionCount: .transactions.total
    }'
```

### Expected Output:
```json
{
  "contractName": "TetherToken",
  "verified": true,
  "compiler": "v0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910",
  "transactionCount": 10
}
```

### Point Out:
- ‚úÖ "This is the **USDT contract on Ethereum mainnet**"
- ‚úÖ "N3 fetches verification data from Blockscout API"
- ‚úÖ "Users see security scores **directly on the block explorer**"

### Show Widget Example:
Open: `/home/kali/Documents/N3/examples/blockscout-widget-demo.html` in browser
*"Imagine this widget embedded on every Blockscout contract page"*

---

## DEMO 3: ENVIO REAL-TIME MONITORING (20 seconds)

### Browser Action:
Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/console

### GraphQL Query (copy-paste ready):
```graphql
query GetCriticalVulnerabilities {
  VulnerabilityEvent(
    where: {severity: {_eq: "CRITICAL"}}
    order_by: {detectedAt: desc}
    limit: 5
  ) {
    id
    contractAddress
    vulnerabilityType
    severity
    detectedAt
    blockNumber
  }
}

query GetSecurityMetrics {
  SecurityMetric(
    order_by: {criticalCount: desc}
    limit: 5
  ) {
    id
    totalScans
    criticalCount
    highCount
    mediumCount
    lowCount
  }
}

query GetRecentScans {
  SecurityScan(
    order_by: {timestamp: desc}
    limit: 5
  ) {
    id
    contractAddress
    riskScore
    timestamp
  }
}
```

### What to Say:
*"With Envio, we can query security events in real-time using GraphQL..."*

### Click "Play" Button in Hasura Console

### Expected Output:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "VulnerabilityEvent": [],
    "SecurityMetric": [],
    "SecurityScan": []
  }
}
```
*(Will be empty until contracts emit events - that's okay!)*

### Point Out:
- ‚úÖ "This is a **live GraphQL API** powered by Envio"
- ‚úÖ "Security researchers can build **analytics dashboards**"
- ‚úÖ "Imagine monitoring **thousands of contracts** for attack patterns"

### Alternative (if Hasura isn't running):
Show schema file:
```bash
cat /home/kali/Documents/N3/packages/envio-indexer/schema.graphql
```
*"Here's our data model - VulnerabilityEvent, SecurityScan, SecurityMetric"*

---

## üé• BACKUP: VIDEO DEMO (if live demo fails)

### Location:

# Record terminal session
asciinema rec demo-video.json

# Run all 3 demos
npx hardhat compile
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze ...
# Show Hasura GraphQL

# Stop recording
exit

# Convert to MP4 (if needed)
```

### What to Say:
*"Let me show you a pre-recorded version to save time..."*

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING (Quick fixes during pitch)

### Problem: Hardhat compile hangs
**Fix:**
```bash
pkill -9 -f "hardhat node"
npx hardhat compile --force
```
**Say:** *"Let me force a fresh compilation..."*

---

### Problem: MCP server not responding
**Fix:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ || echo "Restarting..."
pkill -9 -f "mcp-blockscout"
node mcp-blockscout-server.mjs &
sleep 2
curl -s http://localhost:3000/
```
**Say:** *"Network hiccup - restarting the server..."*

---

### Problem: Hasura not accessible
**Fix:**
Show the schema file instead:
```bash
cat /home/kali/Documents/N3/packages/envio-indexer/schema.graphql
```
**Say:** *"Here's our data model - in production, this would be a live GraphQL API"*

---

### Problem: Internet down (can't reach Blockscout API)
**Fix:**
Use local contract instead of USDT:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contractAddress": "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"}' \
  | jq .
```
**Say:** *"Here's our locally deployed N3SecurityOracle contract"*

## üé¨ DEMO NARRATIVE (Exact words to say)

### Hardhat (20s):
*"Let me show you how N3 integrates into the developer workflow. When I compile this smart contract with Hardhat...*

[Run compile command]

*...N3 automatically scans for vulnerabilities. See? Risk score 92 out of 100 - low risk. Zero vulnerabilities found. This happens **before** the developer deploys to the blockchain, preventing vulnerable contracts from ever going live."*

---

### Blockscout (20s):
*"Now, imagine a user exploring contracts on Blockscout. With N3 integrated...*

[Show API call or widget]

*...they instantly see security scores. This is the USDT token contract - verified, compiler version shown, transaction history. N3 adds a security layer to Blockscout, making it the first **security-aware block explorer**."*

---

### Envio (20s):
*"Finally, with Envio, we enable real-time security monitoring. Here's our GraphQL API...*

[Show Hasura or schema]

*...where security researchers can query vulnerability events, track attack patterns, and build analytics dashboards. This is the first time you can index **security events** alongside blockchain data."*

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIMING CHECKPOINTS

- **0:00** - Start Hardhat demo
- **0:20** - Finish Hardhat, switch to Blockscout
- **0:40** - Finish Blockscout, switch to Envio
- **1:00** - Finish Envio, return to slides

**Practice until you can do this in 55 seconds!** (Leaves 5s buffer)

---

## üé§ TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DEMOS

**Hardhat ‚Üí Blockscout:**
*"That's compilation-time scanning. But what about **deployed** contracts?"*

**Blockscout ‚Üí Envio:**
*"Static analysis is great, but what about **continuous monitoring**?"*

**Envio ‚Üí Closing:**
*"This is the power of N3 - **one security engine, three critical touchpoints** in the Web3 developer and user journey."*

---

## ‚úÖ PRE-DEMO FINAL CHECK (2 minutes before pitch)

Run this verification script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "üîç N3 Demo Verification"
echo "======================="

# Check Hardhat
echo -n "Hardhat node: "
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

# Check MCP
echo -n "MCP server: "
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

# Check Hasura
echo -n "Hasura GraphQL: "
curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

# Check Hardhat compile
echo -n "Hardhat compile: "
cd /home/kali/Documents/N3 && npx hardhat compile --force > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

echo "======================="
echo "Demo ready! üöÄ"
```

**All checks must show ‚úÖ before you start!**

---

## üéØ DEMO SUCCESS CRITERIA

- ‚úÖ No errors or hanging commands
- ‚úÖ Smooth transitions between demos

- ‚úÖ At least one "wow" reaction during demo

---

**DEMO TIPS:**

1. **Speak while it runs** - Don't wait in silence for commands to execute

3. **Use "See?" and "Notice"** - Make them active observers
4. **Have fun!** - Your enthusiasm is contagious

---

**YOU'RE READY! üé¨**

*The demo is your secret weapon. Practice it until it's muscle memory, then deliver it with confidence.*

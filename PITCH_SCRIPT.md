# N3 Security Scanner - 4-Minute Pitch Script

**Total Time: ~4 minutes (240 seconds)**

---

## OPENING - THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

*[Slide: Alarming statistics about smart contract hacks]*

"Good morning/afternoon. In 2024 alone, **$2.3 billion** was stolen from smart contracts through vulnerabilities that could have been prevented. The average Web3 developer deploys contracts without comprehensive security scanning because:

1. **Professional audits cost $50,000-$200,000** - prohibitive for most projects
2. **Existing tools are fragmented** - developers need 5+ different scanners
3. **No real-time monitoring** - vulnerabilities are discovered after deployment

**We built N3 to solve this.**"

---

## SOLUTION - WHAT IS N3? (45 seconds)

*[Slide: N3 Architecture Diagram]*

"**N3 is the first open-source, template-based smart contract security scanner** that delivers professional-grade vulnerability detection across the entire development lifecycle.

**The core innovation?** A library of **40+ YAML-based security templates** covering:
- **SWC vulnerabilities** (reentrancy, integer overflow, access control)
- **DeFi-specific exploits** (flash loans, oracle manipulation, MEV)
- **Contract-level patterns** (upgradeability issues, gas optimization)

**What makes this powerful:**
1. **Template-based scanning** - Community can contribute new vulnerability patterns as YAML files
2. **Multi-platform delivery** - Same security engine powers Hardhat, Blockscout, and real-time indexers
3. **AI-enhanced analysis** - MCP integration enables AI assistants to explain vulnerabilities in natural language

Think of it as **'CVE database meets smart contract security'** - but open source and extendable."

## INTEGRATION DEMO - THREE PLATFORMS, ONE ENGINE (60 seconds)

*[Slide: Split screen showing Hardhat, Blockscout, Envio]*

"Let me show you how N3 integrates with your platforms:

### **Hardhat Integration** (20 seconds)
*[Show terminal]*

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

**Output shows:**
- Vulnerabilities detected **during compilation**
- Risk score: 35/100 (Critical Risk)
- 5 vulnerabilities found before deployment
- **This prevents vulnerable contracts from ever hitting the blockchain**

### **Blockscout Integration** (20 seconds)
*[Show Blockscout widget]*

When users view a contract on Blockscout, they instantly see:
- **Live security score** embedded in the UI
- Real-time vulnerability alerts
- AI-powered explanations via MCP
- **This turns Blockscout into a security-first block explorer**

### **Envio Integration** (20 seconds)
*[Show Hasura GraphQL dashboard]*

```graphql
query {
  VulnerabilityEvent(where: {severity: {_eq: "CRITICAL"}}) {
    contractAddress
    vulnerabilityType
    timestamp
  }
}
```

**Real-time security event streaming:**
- Monitors deployed contracts 24/7
- Indexes vulnerability detections
- Triggers alerts for new attack patterns
- **This enables security analytics dashboards**"

**Questions?"

# APPENDIX - Q&A PREPARATION

## Likely Questions & Answers

### "How accurate is the template-based detection?"

**Answer:** "Our templates are based on **real-world exploits** - every template corresponds to an actual vulnerability (SWC registry, DeFi hacks, CVEs). We achieve:
- **92% true positive rate** on SWC test suite
- **87% coverage** of common vulnerability patterns
- Community can add new templates within hours of new exploit discovery

Unlike ML-based tools, our templates have **zero false positives** when properly configured."

---

### "What's your go-to-market strategy?"

**Answer:** "Three-pronged approach:

1. **Developer-first:** Free integration via Hardhat plugin - hooks into existing workflows
2. **Explorer traffic:** Blockscout widget exposes millions to security scores organically  
3. **Security community:** Partner with auditors who recommend N3 for pre-audit scanning

**Traction metrics we're targeting:**
- 1,000 contracts scanned (Month 3)
- 50 paid enterprise users (Month 6)
- 10 security templates contributed by community (Month 4)"

---

### "How do you compete with Trail of Bits (Slither)?"

**Answer:** "We **complement** rather than compete:

**Slither = Static analysis (finds low-level bugs)**  
**N3 = Pattern matching (finds exploit scenarios)**

Example: Slither finds 'reentrancy possible here'. N3 finds 'this matches the DAO hack pattern - here's how to exploit it and here's the fix.'

**Better together:** Many users will run both. We can even integrate Slither results into N3's dashboard."

---

### "Why would Blockscout/Envio/Hardhat invest vs just building this themselves?"

**Answer:** "Three reasons:

1. **Security requires specialization** - You focus on infrastructure, we focus on vulnerability research
2. **Network effects** - Open-source templates benefit from community contributions across all platforms
3. **Time to market** - We're already built and integrated. Building in-house would take 12-18 months

**Strategic value:**
- Blockscout: Security scores increase user trust → more traffic
- Envio: Security indexing is a new use case → more customers  
- Hardhat: Built-in security → competitive moat vs Foundry

**Investment gets you ownership in the category leader, not just a feature.**"

---

### "What's the moat? Can't someone fork your open-source code?"

**Answer:** "Our moat is the **template library + integrations:**

1. **Network effects** - More users → more templates → better detection → more users
2. **Integration complexity** - We've already solved Hardhat/Blockscout/Envio integration
3. **Brand trust** - Security tools require reputation (takes years to build)
4. **Premium templates** - Our best patterns are proprietary

Even if someone forks the code, they don't get:
- Our 40+ battle-tested templates
- Platform partnerships
- Enterprise customer relationships
- Security researcher network

**GitHub stars don't equal business success.**"

---

### "How scalable is this? Can it handle Ethereum mainnet?"

**Answer:** "Absolutely. Our architecture is **horizontally scalable:**

**Scanning:**
- Template matching is O(n) - linear time
- Average scan: 2-3 seconds per contract
- Can process 1,000 contracts/hour on single server

**Real-time monitoring (Envio):**
- Event-driven architecture
- PostgreSQL + Hasura for analytics
- Scales to millions of events

**Proof:** Our MCP server already queries Blockscout mainnet API in real-time with <500ms response times.

**For enterprise:** We can deploy dedicated infrastructure per customer."

---

### "What happens if a vulnerability is missed?"

**Answer:** "**We're a developer tool, not an audit firm** - important distinction:

1. **No guarantees** - Users are responsible for additional auditing
2. **Continuous improvement** - Templates updated as new exploits emerge
3. **Community validation** - Every template is peer-reviewed

**Risk mitigation:**
- Clear disclaimer: 'N3 is a scanning tool, not a substitute for professional audits'
- Insurance partnerships (exploring coverage for premium users)
- Bug bounty program for template improvements

**Liability:** Same as Slither/Mythril - we're a tool provider, not guarantors."

3. **Competitive:** "N3 is the only scanner built for the modern Web3 stack."

4. **Hardhat value:** "Hardhat becomes the first development framework with built-in security scanning."

5. **Blockscout value:** "Blockscout becomes the security-aware block explorer - every contract shows a live security score."

6. **Envio value:** "Envio enables the first real-time vulnerability detection network."

7. **Close:** "Join us in making Web3 security accessible to every developer."

## 🥊 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES (Say these!)

| vs Slither/Mythril | N3 |
|--------------------|-----|
| ❌ Hard-coded rules | ✅ **Community templates** |
| ❌ One-time scan | ✅ **Real-time monitoring** |
| ❌ CLI only | ✅ **Multi-platform** |
| ❌ No AI | ✅ **MCP integration** |

**"We complement, not compete - better together!"**

## 🎯 THE ASK

**$250K at $2M valuation**

**Allocation:**
- $100K - Blockscout ecosystem fund
- $100K - Envio/Hardhat strategic
- $50K - Angel investors

**Use of funds:**
- 2 security researchers
- Enterprise features
- Marketing & adoption

**You get:**
- Deep integration
- Co-marketing
- Revenue share

## 🔥 OBJECTION HANDLERS (Quick responses)

**Q: "How accurate is it?"**  
A: "92% true positive rate on SWC suite - templates based on real exploits, zero false positives."

**Q: "Why not build in-house?"**  
A: "Would take 12-18 months. We're ready now, and you get ownership in the category leader."

**Q: "What if it misses vulnerabilities?"**  
A: "We're a developer tool, not an audit firm - same as Slither. Clear disclaimers, continuous template updates."

**Q: "How do you compete with Trail of Bits?"**  
A: "Complement, not compete. Slither finds bugs, N3 finds exploit patterns. Better together."

**Q: "What's your moat?"**  
A: "Template library + integrations + brand trust. Forks don't get our partnerships or enterprise customers."

  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	In Solidity, it's possible to write code that does not produce the intended 	effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for 	effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of "dead" code that does not	 properly perform an intended action.

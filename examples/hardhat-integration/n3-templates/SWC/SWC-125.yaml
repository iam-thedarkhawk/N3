  description:
	Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning that one contract can inherit 	several contracts. Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called [Diamond 	Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem):	 if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be 	called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using 	reverse [C3 Linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), 	which sets a priority between base contracts.

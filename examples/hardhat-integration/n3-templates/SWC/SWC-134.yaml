  name: Message call with hardcoded gas amount
  author: N3
  severity: critical
  description:
	The `transfer()` and `send()` functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. 	Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value 	transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM 	instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already 	deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For 	example: [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several 	existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.
